Project Title:The IOT Column Test Project

Project Justification:IoT is tagging our day-to-day objects with machine-readable identification tags. Sensors may 
be a couple with these tags to collect more information about the condition the everyday objects and those present around them.
The time is not that far when you are out of home and your computers at home contact you to let you know that 
your medicines have expired or that the milk is over or you need more pepper.  This isnâ€™t just a fantasy but 
soon to be a reality due to the amazing possibilities of the Internet of Things (IoT).
With this project our team has the opportunity to test and discover the advantages and disadvantages of Internet Of Things.

Project IOT Sensors:
1.MQ2 Smoke Gas LPG Butane Hydrogen Gas Sensor Detector Module For Arduino.

2.Sound Detection Sensor Module Sound Sensor Intelligent Vehicle For Arduino. 

Here are some advantages of IoT:
1. Data: The more the information, the easier it is to make the right decision.
2. Tracking: The computers keep a track both on the quality and the viability of things. 
3. Time: The amount of time saved in monitoring and the number of trips done otherwise would be tremendous.

Here are some disadvantages of IoT:
1. Compatibility: As of now, there is no standard for tagging and monitoring with sensors.
2. Privacy/Security: Privacy is a big issue with IoT. 
3. Safety: There is a chance that the software can be hacked and your personal information misused.
